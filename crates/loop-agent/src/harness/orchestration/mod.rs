//! Orchestration adapter: bridges `loop-orchestration` with `loop-agent` types.
//!
//! This module provides concrete worker implementations (`AgentWorker`,
//! `ShellWorker`, `SubWorkflowWorker`) that plug into the orchestration
//! scheduler, plus memory tool builders that wrap orchestration traits
//! into `AgentTool` instances.
